    B --> E[Architecture Documentation]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[Stakeholder Review & Approval]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Follow TOGAF ADM methodology for systematic architecture development
- Use software architecture documentation templates and viewpoints
- Create architecture artifacts: catalogs, matrices, and diagrams

- Document architectural decisions and rationale

### Phase 3: Data and Information Management
**Primary Documents**: DAMA-DMBOK, TOGAF-9.2, ISO-9001-2015

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Governance Framework] --> B[Data Architecture]
    B --> C[Data Quality Management]
    C --> D[Master Data Management]
    D --> E[Data Security & Privacy]
    E --> F[Data Lifecycle Management]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Implement DAMA-DMBOK data management practices
- Establish data governance council and stewardship roles
- Define data quality metrics and continuous monitoring
- Create data catalogs and metadata management
- Align data architecture with enterprise architecture principles

### Phase 4: Security and Risk Management
**Primary Documents**: SP-800-53, COBIT5, ISO-9001-2015

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Risk Assessment & Analysis] --> B[Security Control Framework]
    B --> C[NIST SP 800-53 Controls Implementation]
    C --> D[Continuous Monitoring]
    D --> E[Risk Management Process]
    E --> F[Compliance Reporting]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Implement NIST SP 800-53 security controls systematically
- Establish risk management framework aligned with COBIT 5
- Create continuous monitoring and assessment processes
- Integrate security requirements into architecture development
- Maintain compliance documentation and audit trails

### Phase 5: Implementation and Operations
**Primary Documents**: All PDFs integrated

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Project Portfolio Management] --> B[Solution Architecture]
    B --> C[Development & Testing]
    C --> D[Deployment & Operations]
    D --> E[Service Management]
    E --> F[Continuous Improvement]
    F --> A
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use integrated framework approach for all implementations
- Apply quality management principles throughout lifecycle
- Maintain architectural compliance and governance
- Monitor and measure against established metrics
- Implement continuous improvement processes
