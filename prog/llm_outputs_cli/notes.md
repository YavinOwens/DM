Pdfs are stupid big , so will need to chunk etc to enable the llm to go through the content. 

what to use? (played with most of these but always seem to use postgress + pg vector, overkill for what im doing but..... need to have a think.)

Postgres + pg vector (Grapling King)
Quadrant (seems unchallenging and pain in the... for simple stuff)
Faiss ( Quick and Easy)
Cromadb ( Quick and Easy)
